This repository showcases programmatic knowledge of the fundamental machine learning techniques, regression and classification.

## Fundamental Algorithms
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/linear-regression-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm iterates through slope and intercept values to minimize total error for a line of best fit through linear data.
2. [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/gradient-descent-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm uses calculus to minimize the error function and select the optimum coefficients for a line of best fit through linear data.
3. [Classification](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/classification-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm plots an unknown point, polls its local environment for labels, and renders a classification based on its finding.

## Projects
Here are custom projects I developed, using a variety of libraries and techniques.

1. [Baby Watson](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/Wikipedia-Search.ipynb) is a function which queries Wikipedia and returns a description of your input.
2. [Flight Simulator](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/rocket-kinematics-simulator.ipynb) takes a rocket engine with a known specific impulse and burn time, and plots its kinematics.
3. [Service Monopoly](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/Terrible-Customer-Service-Bot.ipynb) is a terrible customer service bot.

### [Visualization](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/tree/master/visualization#visualization)
I use python visualization libraries to showcase trends and information using real data.

### [Code Challenges](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/tree/master/code-challenges#code-challenges)
This is a subdirectory where I will host solutions to common programming challenges.
