This repository showcases programmatic knowledge of the fundamental machine learning techniques, regression and classification.

### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/linear-regression-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm iterates through slope and intercept values to minimize total error for a line of best fit through linear data.

### [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/gradient-descent-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm uses calculus to minimize the error function and select the optimum coefficients for a line of best fit through linear data.

### [Classification](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/classification-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm plots an unknown point, polls its local environment for labels, and renders a classification based on its finding.

### Visualization
I use python visualization libraries to showcase trends and information using real data.

[Here](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/matplotlib-visualization.ipynb) I visualize business trends using Matplotlib
[Here](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/seaborn-visualization.ipynb) I use Seaborn to visualize World Cup statistics
[Here](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/real-data-visualization.ipynb) I visualize livestream statistics for Twitch
