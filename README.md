This repository showcases programmatic knowledge of the fundamental machine learning techniques, regression and classification.

### [Linear Regression](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/linear-regression-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm iterates through slope and intercept values to minimize total error for a line of best fit through linear data.

### [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/gradient-descent-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm uses calculus to minimize the error function and select the optimum coefficients for a line of best fit through linear data.

### [Classification](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/classification-algorithm.ipynb)
An algorithm plots an unknown point, polls its local environment for labels, and renders a classification based on its finding.

### [Visualization](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/tree/master/visualization)
I use python visualization libraries to showcase trends and information using real data.

### [Code Challenges](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/tree/master/code-challenges)
This is a subdirectory where I will host solutions to common programming challenges.

### [Science Projects](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/tree/master/science)
I host solutions and work involving scientific problems that interest me.
