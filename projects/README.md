### Projects

Here is a repository of projects I developed.

[Service Monopoly](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/Terrible-Customer-Service-Bot.ipynb) is a terrible customer service bot, who will not help you.

[Baby Watson](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/Wikipedia-Search.ipynb) is a function which queries Wikipedia and returns a description of your input.

[Flight Simulator](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects/blob/master/projects/rocket-kinematics-simulator.ipynb) takes a rocket engine with a known specific impulse and burn time, and plots its kinematics.
